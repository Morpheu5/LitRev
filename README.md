LitRev
======

LitRev (temporary name) is a tool to build annotated literature reviews.

As I was going through my duties as a first year PhD student, I found no tools for literature reviews that did exactly what I needed, and only that, so I started coding one.


License
=======

LitRev is going to be released under GPLv3 unless I change my mind later and unless otherwise specified. I'm quite busy right now so I'm not going to put notices in each and every file: just be nice and reasonable, ok?

Some parts, especially those located under Vendor, may have different licenses. You should refer to them as those parts are concerned.


Closing remarks
===============

None so far. Take it. Enjoy it. Give back. Be happy doing so.

Happy hacking.
